### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on object detection in images/videos, multi-object tracking, and segmentation in remote sensing applications. In addition, other activities include the regression and classification task using time-series data with temporal factor, and student activity monitoring, and dealing with class imbalance datasets. Overall, the current research activities concern context awareness, surveillance and monitoring scenarios, remote sensing, e-health applications, and domain specific artificial intelligence.
